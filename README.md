# jmvScaffold


This package provides a series of R6 classes and function to develop [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) modules. 
I use it for developing my modules [GAMLj](https://github.com/gamlj/gamlj), [jAMM](https://github.com/jamm/jamm), [SEMLj](https://github.com/semlj/semlj) and [PATHj]((https://github.com/pathj/pathj)) but feel free to use it as you wish.

# Reference page 

There is a [manual page](https://mcfanda.github.io/jmvScaffold/docs/index.html) with the classes and functions API

# How to page

There is a [how to page](https://mcfanda.github.io/jmvScaffold/docs/booklet.html) that exemplifies how to use the classes and functions. 


Those pages are  more like a personal memo on how to use the functions, but it may help others too.
