# Introduction {#index}

## Preface 

`r draft`

Here you can find references and description of the functions and techniques in the R package [jmvScaffold](https://github.com/mcfanda/jmvScaffold), which provides several functions and R6 classes for the development of 
`r jamovi` modules. Much of the [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org) module development information
can be found in the [jamovi developer's hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/).

This documentation assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic of jamovi module development, but one may get away without that, and be able to develop a `r jamovi` module only reading these pages.

We should note that developing a `r jamovi` module does not require any of this material. This material, furthermore, will
not make your coding easier than just using `r jamovi` functions as described in [jamovi developer's hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/). However, when your module starts to get a bit complicated, offering several analyses and sub-modules, or when you want your module to do more sophisticate actions, or more refined style, this material may come handy. 

A final word to end the preface: Here we assume that we want to build a jamovi module, store it to (github)[https://github.com], and then publish it in the  `r jamovi` library. If you do not have the second or the third aim (you may want to build a module only for yourself), you can skip the parts related with them.

## Getting Started {#getstarted}

First, you need to get ready for developing a module, so you want to consult [jamovi developer's hub getting started section](https://dev.jamovi.org/tuts0101-getting-started.html). In a nutshell, you need:

* To install `r jamovi` 

* To install `jmvtools` R package, provided by the jamovi core developing group.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('jmvtools', repos=c('https://repo.jamovi.org', 'https://cran.r-project.org'))
```

* To install `jmvScaffold` R package (check out if you need some dependency)

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mcfanda/jmvScaffold")

```

We will see that your module will not need to install `jmvScaffold` to work, you just need it to program.

## Create a module

A module in `r jamovi` is a R package that works also in jamovi. As such, it needs to have all the charateristics
of a R package, plus the additional information and coding required to interface the R package to `r jamovi`. Thus,
to obtain a working module we need to make steps both for the R package and for the jamovi interface.

We now create a new module, named `COOLj`. At the end of this material, the `COOLj` module will look like

!TODO SAY what it does!

[this](https://github.com/mcfanda/testme). First, we create its folder (so be sure you are in a parent folder) and the folders structure with `jmvtool`


```{r eval=FALSE}
jmvtools::create('COOLj')

```

This should produce, in the `COOLj` folder, this structure.

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c1_create_folders.png")`

If you use (RStudio)[https://posit.co/], its a good idea to create a project in the `COOLj` folder, because working with
RStudio projects make our lives much easier.


We now need to fill the `DESCRIPTION` file as for any R package. Here an example

```{r eval=FALSE}
Package: COOLj
Type: Package
Title: Simple example of jmvScaffold
Version: 0.0.1
Author: mcfanda
Maintainer: Mcfanda <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This is an example of
    jmvScaffold
License: GPL
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports: jmvcore (>= 0.8.5), R6
```

This describe your package in R. Now we need to define a description for `r jamovi`, filling the file
`./jamovi/0000.yaml`

```{yaml}
title: Simple example of jmvScaffold
name: COOLj
version: 0.0.1
jms: '1.0'
authors:
  - Mcfanda
maintainer: mcfanda <yourself@somewhere.net>
date: '2023-1-1'
type: R
description: >-
      This is an example of jmvScaffold
analyses: []
usesNative: true
minApp: 1.0.8

```

We will get back to this file later on.

## Defining the analysis

A module can do several things, but at least it should execute one analysis. By `analysis` I mean a set of stats
that would produce some results, such as t-test, a correlation, a machine learning classification algorithm. In this example
we want to develop a module that deal with linear models. We start simply, and aim at producing a linear regression. 
We make it more complex later on. By default, `r jamovi` comes with a nice command `Regression->Linear Regression`, or with the [GAMLj module](https://gamlj.github.io/) for regressions and many other linear models. Here we set this aim for demonstrative purposes.


## jamovi analysis

We want to call this `analysis` `myRegression`. so, we create a file named `myRegression` in the `./jamovi/` folder.

```{r eval=FALSE}
jmvtools::addAnalysis(name='myRegression', title='Regression analysis')

```

The  option `name` decides the name of the R function that will be produced, and the option `title` decides how
the function will be labelled in the `r jamovi` menu (it can be changed later on if needed).

Running the command produces several files. In the `./jamovi/` folder we have

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c1_jamovi_files.png")`

In them, the jamovi input and output features are defined.

* In __*.a.yaml__ the input options are defined (see API here [jamovi hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/api_analysis-definition.html#options)) 
* In __*.u.yaml__ the input layout  is of the user interface is  defined (see API here [jamovi hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/api_ui-definition.html)) 

* In __*.r.yaml__ the output results tables are defined (see API here [jamovi hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/api_results-definition.html)) 

We should fill them all.
