## Introduction

So far we defined `jmvcore::Table` objects. Tables, however, are not the only `jmvcore::Results` object available to the module developer. The results will usually go into tables, but the result tables can be organized in a more rational way, or be created programmatically depending on the module needs. Here are a few useful objects. 

## Groups (jmvcore::Group)

A useful object is the `jmvcore::Group`. Groups allow structuring the result tables into sections. Assume, for instance, we want to put our `coefficients` and `anova` tables in a `Main Results` section of the output, and our `effects` table under `Additional Output`, to be filled later on with other tables.

We should change the `r.yaml` file introducing the `Group` object:

`r filehead("jamovi/myregression.a.yaml",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{yaml eval=FALSE}

---
name:  myRegression
title: Regression analysis
jrs:   '1.1'

items:

       - name: main
         type: Group
         title: Main Results
         items:
           - name: coefficients
             title:  Parameter Estimates (Coefficients)
             type: Table
             columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                      ...
                      ## here the remaing of the columns as defined before

           - name: anova
             title:  ANOVA table
             type: Table
             columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                      ...
                      ## here the remaing of the columns as defined before

       - name: additional
         type: Group              
         title: Additional Results
         items:
           - name: effects
             title:  Effect Size Indices
             type: Table
             columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                      ...
                      ## here the remaing of the columns as defined before


```

Notice that the definition of the tables has not changed, they are just organized under a `Group` with property `title` and `items`.

The logic of interfacing R code with the tables via a `SmartTable` object in file `.b.R` does not change as well, the only difference is that we should change the name of the table. In the `self$results` list, tables are now referred to as `self$results$groupname$tablename`.

`r filehead("R/myregression.b.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

## same code as before here
...
        .init = function() {
            
            if (!is.something(self$options$dep) | !is.something(self$options$covs))
                return()
            # define the runner
            private$.runner<-Runner$new(self)
            
            # set up the coefficients SmartTable
            atable<-SmartTable$new(self$results$main$coefficients,private$.runner)
            # put the SmartTable in the list
            private$.tables[[length(private$.tables)+1]]<-atable
            # set up the anova SmartTable
            atable<-SmartTable$new(self$results$main$anova,private$.runner)
            # put the SmartTable in the list
            private$.tables[[length(private$.tables)+1]]<-atable
            
            atable<-SmartTable$new(self$results$additional$effects,private$.runner)
            # put the SmartTable in the list
            private$.tables[[length(private$.tables)+1]]<-atable
            
            # the remaining code does not change
            ...
```

Consequently, in the `Runner.R` file their associated function should be named  `run_[groupname]_[tablename]`, because they `[groupname]_[tablename]` nickname uniquely identifies each table. In `Runner.R` code:

`r filehead("R/Runner.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

    run_main_coefficients=function() {
      
      .summary         <-   summary(self$model)
      coeffs           <-  .summary$coefficients
      coeffs           <-   as.data.frame(coeffs)
      names(coeffs)    <-   c("coef","se","t","p")
      coeffs$var       <-   rownames(coeffs) 
      return(coeffs)
    },
    run_main_anova=function() {
      
      .anova          <-  as.data.frame(car::Anova(self$model,type=3))
       names(.anova)  <-  c("nothing","df1","test","p")
      .anova$df2      <-  self$model$df.residual
      .anova$var      <-  rownames(.anova)
      return(.anova)
      },
    run_additional_effects=function() {

      eps       <-  effectsize::epsilon_squared(self$model)
      eps_df    <-  data.frame(var=eps$Parameter,index="Epsilon^2",value=eps$Epsilon2)
      eta       <-  effectsize::eta_squared(self$model)
      eta_df    <-  data.frame(var=eta$Parameter,index="pEta^2",value=eta$Eta2)
      omega     <-  effectsize::omega_squared(self$model)
      omega_df  <-  data.frame(var=eta$Parameter,index="pOmega^2",value=omega$Omega2)

      tab       <-  rbind(eps_df,eta_df,omega_df)
      return(tab)
    },


```

You should now have your output organized in sections like this:

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c4_output1.png")`


## Arrays of tables (jmvcore::Array)

Arrays of tables are complex objects that allow for a lot of flexibility in setting up results tables. They contain tables like groups do, but the number of tables created in an array is flexible and depends on the input or the results. We can distinguish two typical cases. When the number of tables depends on an option defined in the GUI (in the `.a.yaml` file), or when the number of tables depends on some calculation done in the R code, so not directly linked to an option. Let's see the two cases in detail.

### Array: known number of tables

Assume we want to produce a table for each covariate selected by the user. Say that for each covariate you want a separate table with the mean and standard deviation of the variable. Obviously, we do not know in advance how many independent variables the user will define, but as soon as the user defines them, `r jamovi` can count the independent variables and know how many tables are needed. In our example, we can link the number of tables (`items`) attached to the `Array` object to the `covs` option. This can be done directly in the `yaml` code in `.r.yaml` file.

`r filehead("jamovi/myregression.r.yaml",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{yaml}

#...#
       - name: means
         title: Mean and Standard deviation
         type: Array
         items: (covs)
         template:
                title:  Variable - $key
                type: Table
                columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                    - name: mean
                      title: "Mean"
                      type: number
                    - name: sd
                      title: "Sd"
                      type: number


```

Notice the `items` property. We set it to `(covs)` to signal `jamovi` to take the contents of the option `covs` from the input, and create one table for each item found in `covs`. Thus, for each covariate selected by the user a `Table` is created as specified in the `template:` property. In the following example, I get two tables because I selected two covariates.

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c4_output2.png")`

Notice the individual table title. It is set to the name of a covariate because in the `title:` property we use the special key `$key`, which means the name of the item found in `items:` variable. All this is done automatically by `jamovi` interpreter, so it is very easy and smooth to define arrays like this.

Now we can populated each table within the array. First, we go to the `.b.R` file and define the array.

`r filehead("R/myregression.b.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

## same code as before here
#...#
        .init = function() {
              
            ## same code as before here
            #...#
          
            # set up the means SmartArray
            obj<-SmartArray$new(self$results$means,private$.runner)
            # put the SmartArray in the list
            private$.tables[[length(private$.tables)+1]]<-obj

            # the remaining code does not change
#...#
```

Here we use a different `jmvScaffold` object, called `r ext_url("SmartArray","reference/SmartArray.html")`. Its API is equivalent to the one of a
`r ext_url("SmartTable","reference/SmartTable.html")`, but passes all the defined properties to the children tables.

In the `Runner.R` file we should set up a function named `run_[arrayname]` to fill it. This function should return a list of data.frame, one for each item selected in the option associated with the array. In our example, the function should return a list of data.frame, one for each covariate selected by the users. Obviously, it is the developer responsibility to return a list of length equal to the number of items in the array.

`r filehead("R/Runner.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

# ... #

run_means=function() {
      
  tabs  <-  lapply(self$analysis$options$covs, function (x) {
                      m  <- mean(self$analysis$data[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
                      s  <- sd(self$analysis$data[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
                     data.frame(var=x,mean=m,sd=s)
               })

 return(tabs)
    }

# ... #

```


Results should now be nice as expected.

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c4_output3.png")`

### Array: Unknown number of tables

Recall the results in 

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c3_output4.png")`

Assume now, for some silly reason, that we want additional tables with means and standard deviations only for covariates that have a significant effect on the dependent variable. In this case, we do not know how many tables we need until we run the analysis and check the results. `jmvScaffold::SmartArray` can handle this case smoothly: It produces and fills as many tables as we pass to it with a list of data.frame. Let us see an example.

In the `r.yaml` file, we define a new Array as the one before, but without the `items:(covs)` property, because we do not know which of the `covs` variable will require a table. We also put the array under a group, because it looks better in the output page.

`r filehead("jamovi/myregression.r.yaml",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{yaml}
#...#
       - name: sig
         type: Group
         title: Significant covariates
         items: 
           - name: means
             title: ""
             type: Array
             template:
                title:  Variable - $key
                type: Table
                clearWith:
                   - dep
                   - covs

                columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                    - name: mean
                      title: "Mean"
                      type: number
                    - name: sd
                      title: "Sd"
                      type: number



```

In the `Runner.R` file, we simply need to define a `run_sig_means()` function to select the covariates that we want to display in the new tables.

`r filehead("R/Runner.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}
#...#

   run_sig_means=function() {
      ## select the covs ##
      results      <-   as.data.frame(summary(self$model)$coefficients)
      results      <-   results[-1,]
      whichcovs    <-   rownames(results[results[,4]<.05,])

      ## make the tables
      tabs     <-  lapply(whichcovs, function (x) {
                   m  <- mean(self$analysis$data[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
                   s  <- sd(self$analysis$data[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
                   data.frame(var=x,mean=m,sd=s)
      })

      return(tabs)
   }
 
```

Finaly, we add the new array to the list of smart objects in the `.b.R` files.

`r filehead("R/myregression.b.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

## same code as before here
#...#
        .init = function() {
              
            ## same code as before here
            #...#
          
            # set up the sig_means SmartArray
            obj<-SmartArray$new(self$results$sig$means,private$.runner)
            # put the SmartArray in the list
            private$.tables[[length(private$.tables)+1]]<-obj

            # the remaining code does not change
#...#
```

and we can check after re-installing that the module is working as intended.

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c4_output4.png")`

Now pay attention to the tables titles. They are now `Variable - 1` and `Variable - 2` because we do not have any key defined. No problem, we can pass the keys to the `SmartArray` as an attribute of the data we pass to it. Just add to the `run_means()` function the line and you have your nice titles.

`r filehead("R/Runner.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.4")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

      # ... #

      
    run_sig_means=function() {
        ## select the covs ##
        results      <-   as.data.frame(summary(self$model)$coefficients)
        results      <-   results[-1,]
        whichcovs    <-   rownames(results[results[,4]<.05,])
        
        ## make the tables
        tabs     <-  lapply(whichcovs, function (x) {
            m  <- mean(self$analysis$data[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
            s  <- sd(self$analysis$data[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
            data.frame(var=x,mean=m,sd=s)
        })
        attr(tabs,"keys")<-whichcovs ## passing the keys to the jamovi table
        return(tabs)
    }

      # ... #

```

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c4_output5.png")`

## Other Results objects

`r jamovi` offers other results objects, very important to develop modules such as `Image` for diplaying plots, or `Html` widget to display text using `html`. They are not handled by `jmvScaffold` and can easely be filled by accessing to them directly. 

Information about these objects can be found in `r ext_url("jamovi hub: Results","https://dev.jamovi.org/api_results-definition.html")` .
