## Introduction

Not every table is useful every time we run the analysis. Sometimes you want to hide a table, sometimes a hidden table should appear. `r jamovi` allows hiding and showing the tables as default and programmatically, `jmvScaffold` helps make the process a bit smoother.

Let's make our module a bit more complex adding one option in the GUI. It allows the user to show the `sig_means` array, that we now want hidden by default.

In the `.a.yalm` file, we add this two options.

`r filehead("jamovi/myregression.a.yaml",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.5")`
```{yaml}
#...#
    - name: show_means
      title: "Show Means for Sig."
      type: Bool
      default: false
#...#
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c5_input1.png")`

## Showing table on options change

In this example, we want the `sig_means` array to be shown only when the user selects `Show means for Sig.` in the GUI. We need to modify the `.r.yaml` file as follows:

`r filehead("jamovi/myregression.r.yaml",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.5")`
```{yaml}
#...#
       - name: sig
         type: Group
         title: Significant covariates
         visible: (show_means)
         items: 
           - name: means
             title: ""
             type: Array
             visible: (show_means)
             template:
                title:  Variable - $key
                type: Table
                columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                    - name: mean
                      title: "Mean"
                      type: number
                    - name: sd
                      title: "Sd"
                      type: number


#...#
```

Notice the `visible:` property. This means that the Array will be shown only if `show_means` is set to TRUE, thus when the user flags it. No other modification of the code is required. Notice, furthermore, that given the way `SmartArray` and `SmartTable` are implemented, if the table or the array is not visible, the functions to fill it are not run, so an advantage in performance is gained by not running computation that is not need.

If you want a table or array to be visible by default by hidden by choice, just set the default of the associated option as true.

## Showing tables programmatically

Sometimes you want your module to show tables only when necessary, and the necessity arises from the results. As an example, assume that you want to show the section `Additional Ouput` only if there is some significant results (again, silly example but we need a case in studying). With this aim, we do not know in advance if the table will be shown, so we have to make it visible only when the results suggest so.

There are different strategies to accomplish that, maybe the easiest one is the following.

Define in the `r.yaml` file the table as not visible by default with `visible: false`.

`r filehead("jamovi/myregression.r.yaml",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.5")`
```{yaml}

       - name: additional
         type: Group
         title: Additional Results
         items:
           - name: effects
             title:  Effect Size Indices
             type: Table
             visible: false  ## here we set the default as not visible
             columns:
                    - name: var
                      title: "Variable"
                      type: text
                    - name: index
                      title: "Index"
                      type: text
                    - name: value
                      title: "Value"
                      type: number
                      format: zto


```

Then go to the `.b.R` file, in the `init()` function, and set the proporties of the table as shown here.

`r filehead("R/myregression.b.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.5")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

    atable                <- SmartTable$new(self$results$additional$effects,private$.runner)
    atable$activateOnData <- TRUE
    private$.tables[[length(private$.tables)+1]]<-atable

```

The `$activateOnData` property is crucial here: It tells the `SmartTable` to check its data source (i.e. `runner$run_additional_effects()`) and make itself visible only if it receives some data.

Now we need to be sure that the `run_additional_effects()` returns something only if there is a significant result in the coefficients.
In the `Runner.R` file, we change the function in:

`r filehead("R/Runner.R",FILEREF,"Version.0.0.5")`
```{r eval=FALSE}

run_additional_effects=function() {
  
  ## check the covs ##
  results      <-   as.data.frame(summary(self$model)$coefficients)
  results      <-   results[-1,]
  whichcovs    <-   rownames(results[results[,4]<.05,])
  if (length(whichcovs)==0) 
    return(NULL)
  
  eps       <-  effectsize::epsilon_squared(self$model)
  eps_df    <-  data.frame(var=eps$Parameter,index="Epsilon^2",value=eps$Epsilon2)
  eta       <-  effectsize::eta_squared(self$model)
  eta_df    <-  data.frame(var=eta$Parameter,index="pEta^2",value=eta$Eta2)
  omega     <-  effectsize::omega_squared(self$model)
  omega_df  <-  data.frame(var=eta$Parameter,index="pOmega^2",value=omega$Omega2)
  
  tab       <-  rbind(eps_df,eta_df,omega_df)
  return(tab)
},


```

If you are using the `Big 5` data buddled with `r jamovi`, you can try predicting `Neuroticism` with `Openess`, which will not show the table, and then with `Agreebleness`, which will show the table

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c5_output2.png")`

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c5_output3.png")`


## Additional strategies

Usually the `yaml` property `visible:(option)` or the `SmartTable` `$activateOnData` are sufficient for all cases of dynamic table appearance. If, however, the developer needs more flexibility, one can set the `visible:` property to `false`, and use `$activated` property of `SmartTable`. `$activated` accept `TRUE` or `FALSE`, and it is equivalent to the jamovi function `table$setVisible(BOOL)`. Using `$activated`, however, will also not run the code required to fill the table when `$activated<-FALSE`, so you do not need to take precaution again running useless computation.
